* What did I learn today?
  * Read some doc of QMK
  * More about C++ Macro. Understood `#defile something(a, b, d) {a, b, c, d}` in `LAYOUT()` by reading [#define in C with curly braces](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22524250/define-in-c-with-curly-braces)

It's been a while since I gathered my courage to note my daily programming progress. I'm back now. I'm going to keep my daily accountability, productivity and progress in check. (Damn copilot is really smart to suggest this auto completion for me.)

* What did I try to do today?
  * `Starship` doesn't show shell prompt. I am worried that poorly configured `Starship` prompt could hinder the Python virtual environment prompt (for learning Django REST framework). Tried everything. Don't really want to rush-learn rust and go through the source code. So I just disenabled `Starship` prompt for now. 
* What did I learn today?
  * I guess I need to prioritize and just let the not-important-thing-for-now go. (But I really fear asking other programmers about this caz I don't want them to think "this guy is a noob who doesn't read the doc". I need to give myself some chances to be mocked and laughed at in exchange for knowledge.)
  * Treat this potential bug as a opportunity to learn and contribute to. Think about what I can accomplish if I can successfully identify the bug and correct it.
